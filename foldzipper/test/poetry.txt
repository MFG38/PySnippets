Is it comparable to a summer day?
You are so beautiful and peaceful.
Large leaves, wind and waves, May,
Short summer body.
Sometimes the sky is so warm, the eyes polite
There is no price.
And now the beautiful waterfall
He never drove.
But the eternal law cannot be dissolved.
Do not miss the show.
When we give something, we cast a shadow
If you continue, you will add it.
Who does not see when I breathe
Let's give life to life.
