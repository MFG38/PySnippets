# PySnippets
A collection of Python programming experiments (and maybe proper tools later).

## Scripts and their descriptions

* **battleship.py:** A simple game of Battleship. 'Nuff said.
* **code_eval.py:** A simple prompt that asks how many lines of code you have and prints a comment based on your input. Mainly done for practice.
* **insultgen.py:** Generates a random insult from a pre-determined selection of words and phrases. Current number of possible combinations: 1,232.
* **looptest.py:** Testing a looping script. You can talk to it. Sort of.
* **luckynumgen.py:** Feed this script a number and it generates a random one in the range of 1 and the number you entered.
* **passwordgen.py:** (UNFINISHED) Generates a random password that's 8-32 characters in length.
